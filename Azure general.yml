    - up to date

Types of cloud computing
    - SaaS
        - ran and managed by service provider
    - PaaS

Total Cost of Ownership
    - Ice Berg example (top of ice berg is cost at startup, ice below is running and maintenance fees)
    - on premise has high up front and high maintenance costs
    - cloud has lower up front and maintenance cost(save 75 percent)

Cloud Architecture Terminologies
    [Availability]
        - ensure service remains available
    [scalability]
        - grow rapidly
    [Elasticity]
        - shrink and grow to meet demand
    [Fault Tolerance]
        - prevent failures
    [Disaster Rrecovery]
        - recover from failure

High Availability
    - service remain available by ensureing no SINGLE point of failure
    - redundancy
    - run workload across multiple availability zones
    - Azure Load balancer
        - distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or more datacenters. If datacenter
        becomes unhealthy(unavailable) load balancer will route traffic to only available datacenters and servers

High Scalability
    - ability to increase capacity based on increasing demand of traffic, memory, and computing power
    [Vertical scaling]
        - scale up
        - upgrade to bigger servers
        - faster computers
        - upgrade memory
    [Horizontal Scaling]
        - scale out
        - add more servers of same size
        - add more computers
        - add more memory
        - add more storage

High Elasticity
    - auto increase or descrease capacity based on demand of traffic, memory, compute power
    - add mores servers 
    - remove more servers
    [Horizontal sclaing]
        - scale out
            - add more servers of same size
        - scale in
            - remove servers of same size

High Durability
    - recover from disaster and prevent data loss
    - DR

Evolution of Computing
    [dedicated]
        - physical server used by single customer
        - upgrade is slow and expensive
    [VMS]
        - multiple applications on single machine
        - uses hypervisor
        - physical server shared
        - over pay for underutilized VM
        - limited by guest OS
        - multpile apps can still result in conflict
    [Containers]
        - VM running containers
        - Docker Daemon
            - most common, run multiple containers
        - utilize capacity which is cost effective
        - share underlying OS
        - multiple apps run side by side
    [functions]
        - managed VM running mnaged containers
        - AKA SERVERLESS Compute
        - very cost effective
        - responsible for code and data
        - cold starts is side affect

GLobal Infrastructure( Regions and Geography)
    - Region
        - grouping of multiple datacenters(availability zones)
        - AZ has 58 Regions across 140 countries
        - region paired with other region 300 miles away
        - one region updated at a time
        - some rely on paired regions for Disaster Recovery
        - Azure Geo-redundant Storage (GRS)
            - replicates data to secondary region auto to ensure data is durable if primary fails
    - Geography
        - discreet market of 2 or more regions that preserve data residency and compliance boubdaries
    
Region types and Service Availability 
    - not all azure services available in every region
    - Reccomended Region
        - provides broadest range of services designed to support availability Zones nor or in future
    - Alternate Region
        - extends azure footrpint within data residency boundary where reccomended region also exists. not designed to support AZs.

General availability
    - when service is ready to be used publicly by everyone
    - grouped into 3 categories
